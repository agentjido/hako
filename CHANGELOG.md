## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Hardened the public API contract to return deterministic shapes only:
  - `:ok`
  - `{:ok, value}`
  - `{:error, %Jido.VFS.Errors.*{}}`
- Standardized unsupported operation errors to `%Jido.VFS.Errors.UnsupportedOperation{operation, adapter}`.
- Added `Jido.VFS.supports?/2` for explicit adapter capability checks.
- Standardized `Jido.VFS.revisions/3` output to `%Jido.VFS.Revision{}` across versioned adapters.
- Removed legacy `:hako` runtime config reads; adapters now use `:jido_vfs` only.
- Hardened cross-filesystem copy fallback to use capability checks and tempfile spooling for bounded memory.
- Added adapter metadata guardrails:
  - metadata callbacks (`unsupported_operations/0`, `versioning_module/0`) are now required by `Jido.VFS.Adapter`
  - built-in adapters now implement metadata callbacks explicitly
  - added metadata contract tests plus a failing-path behaviour warning test for missing callbacks
- Added an adapter onboarding checklist and linked it from README/CONTRIBUTING.

### Fixed
- Normalized adapter error mapping to avoid raw string/atom leaks from public API paths.
- Fixed `InvalidPath` construction in Local adapter to use the `invalid_path:` field.
- Hardened ETS version storage to avoid dynamic atom creation.
- Improved S3 edge behavior:
  - paginated list/delete for large object sets
  - multipart upload abort on halted/error flows
  - prefix-scoped clear semantics
  - path-scoped visibility resolution
- Hardened GitHub API error mapping for malformed content and API failures.

### Migration Notes
- `{:error, :unsupported}` has been replaced by `%Jido.VFS.Errors.UnsupportedOperation{}`.
- Callers that inferred adapter capabilities from error payloads should use `Jido.VFS.supports?/2`.
- `revisions/3` consumers should expect `%Jido.VFS.Revision{}` values (with `sha` populated for all versioned adapters).
- Runtime configuration for Git/GitHub must use `:jido_vfs` app env keys.
